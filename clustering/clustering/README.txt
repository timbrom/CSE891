This program clusters the population of avida organisms into
species using phylogenetic tree data. Given avida output files
(detail_pop and historic_dump) and a user-specified score cutoff
value, it returns the centres of each cluster (a genotype id) and its
associated score, and then lists each genotype, the cluster to which
it belongs, and its distance in the tree to the cluster centre and
writes it to a user-specified output file.

syntax:
treeCS <detail_pop_file> <historic_dump_file> <output_file> <cutoff>

Note:
This code was compiled with gcc 2.96. It may need modifications to
compile properly with newer versions.
